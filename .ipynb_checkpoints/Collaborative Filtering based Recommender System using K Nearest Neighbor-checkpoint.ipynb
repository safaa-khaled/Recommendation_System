    "In this lab, you have learned and implemented KNN-based collaborative filtering. It is probably the simplest but very effective and intuitive collaborative filtering algorithm. Since it is based on KNN, it inherits the main characteristics of KNN such as memory-intensive because you need to maintain a huge similarity matrix among users or items. In the future labs, we will learn other types of collaborative filtering which do not rely on such a huge similarity matrix to make rating predictions.\n"
